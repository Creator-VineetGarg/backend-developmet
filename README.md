# Backend Development Learnings

This repository contains my learnings and practice projects related to backend development using JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.


## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of my exercises, projects, and experiments aimed at solidifying my understanding of backend development concepts and technologies. Each section focuses on a different aspect of backend development, including server-side programming with Node.js, database management with MongoDB, and building APIs with Express.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language used for server-side scripting and backend development.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing and managing data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Express:** A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications.
