1. NodeJS Project 

2.  Register a User 
For that we have to add some dependencies
- express
- mongoose
- bcryptjs
- jsonwebtoken

3. Create Model 
- user.model.js

4. Creating a Admin User
--> server.js 
    --> start server 
    --> Connect to MongoDB
    --> Admin User

5. API to register the user
    --> Controller
        --> Read the request body
        --> Insert the data in the MongoDB
        --> Return the response
    --> Route
        --> If to app gets POST request then authController.signup get calls

--> Brought the route to the server and give the app object

// Now all things are connceted

--> To convert the json file into js object we use Middle Ware
